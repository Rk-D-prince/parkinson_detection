# Parkinson_Detection

# Project Description:
Provide a concise overview of the project's goal: to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques.  Mention the algorithms used (SVM, XGBoost).

# Dataset:
Describe the dataset used (e.g., "Parkinson's Disease Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository").
The dataset contains 195 samples and 23 features.

# Methodology:
Data preprocessing included handling missing values, and feature scaling.

Describe the machine learning models used:

# Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVMs are supervised machine learning algorithms that find the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes, maximizing the margin between them.

# XGBoost: 
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library that efficiently implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework

Evaluation metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).
