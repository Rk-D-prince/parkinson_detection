## parkinson_detection

#Project Description: Provide a concise overview of the project's goal: to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques.  Mention the algorithms used (SVM, XGBoost).

#Dataset:

Describe the dataset used (e.g., "Parkinson's Disease Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository").

Specify the source of the dataset and provide a link if available.

Mention the key features in the dataset (e.g., biomedical voice measurements).

State the size of the dataset (e.g., number of samples, number of features).  For example: "The dataset contains 195 samples and 23 features."

#Methodology:

Explain the data preprocessing steps.  For example: "Data preprocessing included handling missing values, and feature scaling."

Describe the machine learning models used:

#Support Vector Machine (SVM): Briefly explain the SVM algorithm and any specific parameters used.  Mention the accuracy achieved: "The SVM model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set."

#XGBoost: Briefly explain the XGBoost algorithm and any parameter tuning performed.  Mention the accuracy achieved: "The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of Y% on the test set."

Mention the evaluation metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).

#Results:

Summarize the performance of the models.  For example:  "XGBoost outperformed SVM with a higher accuracy of Y%."

Include the confusion matrix.

State the training and testing accuracy for each model.
